dplyr v2.1.1
https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr
dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:
- mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- select() picks variables based on their names.
- filter() picks cases based on their values.
- summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
These all combine naturally with group_by() which allows you to perform any operation “by group”. You can learn more about them in vignette("dplyr"). As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in vignette("two-table").
