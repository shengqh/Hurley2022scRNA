Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes). The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis PNAS paper (PMID: 16199517) fully describes the algorithm. The GSEA software makes it easy to run the analysis and review the results, allowing you to focus on interpreting the analysis results.
