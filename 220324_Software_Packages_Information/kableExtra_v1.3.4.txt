kableExtra v1.3.4
https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra
Overall, to construct complex tables with knitr::kable() + %>%. This is a very simple table generator. It is simple by design. It is not intended to replace any other R packages for making tables. With kableExtra, you can: 
- Use default base kable() (Or a good alternative for markdown tables is pander::pander()) for all simple tables
- Use kable() with kableExtra to generate 90 % of complex/advanced/self-customized/beautiful tables in either HTML or LaTeX
- Only have to mess with raw HTML/LaTeX in the last 10% cases where kableExtra cannot solve the problem
