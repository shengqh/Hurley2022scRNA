reshape2 v1.4.4
https://github.com/hadley/reshape
Reshape2 is a reboot of the reshape package. It's been over five years since the first release of reshape, and in that time I've learned a tremendous amount about R programming, and how to work with data in R. Reshape2 uses that knowledge to make a new package for reshaping data that is much more focused and much much faster. Note that reshape2 is superseded: only changes necessary to keep it on CRAN will be made.

Reshaping Data with the reshape Package: This paper presents the reshape package for R, which provides a common framework for many types of data reshaping and aggregation. It uses a paradigm of 'melting' and 'casting', where the data are 'melted' into a form which distinguishes measured and identifying variables, and then 'cast' into a new shape, whether it be a data frame, list, or high dimensional array. The paper includes an introduction to the conceptual framework, practical advice for melting and casting, and a case study.
