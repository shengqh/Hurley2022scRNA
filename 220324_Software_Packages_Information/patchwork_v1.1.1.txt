https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork
The goal of patchwork is to make it ridiculously simple to combine separate ggplots into the same graphic. As such it tries to solve the same problem as gridExtra::grid.arrange() and cowplot::plot_grid but using an API that incites exploration and iteration, and scales to arbitrily complex layouts.


System Requirements:
Requires R to be installed, and ggplot2 (â‰¥ 3.0.0), gtable, grid, stats, grDevices, utils, and graphics.


Installation Guide:
https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork#readme

Demo:
